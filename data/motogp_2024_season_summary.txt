2024 MotoGP Season Summary:

The 2024 MotoGP season had 20 races. Ducati dominated, winning 17 of them with multiple teams.
They secured the Constructors' Championship clearly ahead of all competitors.

RIDERS' CHAMPIONSHIP
Jorge Martín (Pramac Ducati) became World Champion. He won only 3 races but stayed consistent and avoided big crashes.
→ Question for 2025: Can he maintain this stable form under pressure as a defending champion?

BAGNAIA’S SEASON
Francesco Bagnaia (Ducati Lenovo) won 11 of 20 races – more than anyone else. He also had 6 poles and 6 fastest laps.
But he crashed too often and lost critical points.
→ Implication: Ducati’s fastest rider has a performance ceiling, but also a risk ceiling. Will he adjust his style in 2025?

MARC MÁRQUEZ
Márquez (Gresini Ducati) won 3 races and showed strong pace again after years without a win.
→ Question: Is Márquez finally back to top form, or were these isolated flashes?

ENEAS BASTIANINI
Bastianini (Ducati Lenovo) won 2 races and set 3 fastest laps, but lacked overall impact in the championship.
→ Implication: Ducati has depth, but managing multiple title-capable riders might be a challenge.

MAVERICK VIÑALES
Viñales (Aprilia) became the first rider in the MotoGP era to win races with 3 different manufacturers.
→ Question: Can Aprilia build on this moment and deliver a full season threat?

ROOKIE PEDRO ACOSTA
Acosta set 2 fastest laps and took a podium. He was one of the youngest to ever do so.
→ Implication: KTM’s long-term hopes likely lie with him. Is he ready to lead a factory team?

FINAL THOUGHTS
Ducati is dominant, but its internal battle between Bagnaia, Martín, Márquez, and Bastianini is escalating. This creates both opportunity and tension.

→ Big 2025 Questions:
- Can Martín repeat under higher pressure?
- Will Bagnaia adapt his style to avoid crashes?
- Is Márquez really back for a full title run?
- Can KTM or Aprilia close the gap to Ducati?

2024 gave us dominance, but not clarity on who is next.
